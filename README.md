# Learned Downsampling of Event Data using a convolutional-spiking VAE

A convolutional-spiking VAE (with MMD prior) and a spiking classifier built on its encoder. Everything runs from notebooks.

### Files

VAE_Clf_NMNIST_FullRun.ipynb — end-to-end on N-MNIST

### Highlights

Time-distributed CNNs (Conv3d)

LIF neurons + surrogate gradients

VAE latent with MMD prior

Optional spiking classifier head

### Datasets

Use N-MNIST and PokerDVS.
Set dataset paths in the notebook cells as indicated.
